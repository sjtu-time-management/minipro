# minipro

A time management WeChat Mini Program especially designed for SJTU students. Help you become the master of your own time!

[中文说明](https://github.com/sjtu-time-management/minipro/blob/master/README_zh_CN.md)

## Getting Started

**Time Management SJTU** is developed with [WeChat DevTools](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/en/dev/devtools/download.html). With Mini Program debugging, developers can debug the Mini Program APIs and pages, view and edit codes, preview and publish the Mini Program, etc. More details at [WeChat Official Document](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/en/dev/framework/).

Due to the fact that the Mini Program has something to do with providing services such as memos, diaries, etc., which are not available for Mini Programs of personal type, **Time Management SJTU** has not yet been released as we are not able to apply for an enterprise account.

## Feature

- **Add or delete your courses and events.** After selecting your major and your grade, the program will provide corresponding compulsory courses when you attempt to add a course into your timetable. It makes the operation of adding courses easier and faster.
- **View your timetable.** You can view your own schedule on the timetable page, where information of your courses and events is shown.
- **View the weather forecast.** We also display daily weather forecast on the timetable page.
- **Event reminder.** When adding courses or events, you can set a reminder. The program will send a message via WeChat Official Account at the time that you set previously.
- **Early sleep and early wake up clock in.** You can clock in and leave clock-in messages in the morning or at night during specific period of time. The function is set to encourage everyone to go to bed early and to get up early, thus developing a good habit. You can also see others’ clock-in message on the clock-in page. Enter the clock-in rank page and you can see your clock-in ranking among all users.
